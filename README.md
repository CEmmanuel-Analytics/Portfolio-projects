#  Country Layoffs SQL Project

This project focuses on analyzing **total layoffs by country** using SQL. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed to explore global trends, patterns, and insights related to workforce reductions across industries and locations.

##  Objectives

-  Clean and transform raw layoff data using SQL  
-  Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends  
-  Determine which countries experienced the highest number of layoffs  
-  Analyze layoffs over time by **country**, **industry**, and **location**  

##  Tools Used

- **MySQL** – For data cleaning, transformation, and querying  
- **DB Tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench / DBeaver)** – For query execution  
- **Git & GitHub** – For version control and publishing  

## SQL Tasks Covered

- Removing `NULL` and duplicate values  
- Aggregating total layoffs by country, industry, and location  
- Sorting and filtering trends to draw meaningful insights  
- Time series analysis using SQL `DATE` functions  

##  Dataset Information

The dataset includes layoff records from various companies globally, featuring:

- `Company`  
- `Country`  
- `Industry`  
- `Total Laid Off`  
- `Percentage Laid Off`  
- `Location`  
- `Stage`  
- `Date`  
- `Funds Raised (in millions)`

>  **Note**: The dataset was collected from publicly available sources.

##  How to Use This Project

1. Clone the repository or download the SQL files  
2. Import the dataset into MySQL (e.g., via MySQL Workbench)  
3. Run the provided SQL queries to perform cleaning and analysis  
4. Review insights such as:
   - Top 5 countries with highest layoffs  
   - Monthly trends by country and industry  
   - Industries most affected globally  

## Future Work

- Build a dashboard (e.g., in Power BI or Tableau) using this dataset  
- Automate monthly updates with Python and SQL  
- Compare layoffs by company size or funding stage
